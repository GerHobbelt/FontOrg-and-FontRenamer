## How do I grab this?

Two ways to achive the same:

1. click the green **Code** button above, you'll see a dropdown. Pick "Download ZIP"
2. [click on darker "Releases" title (middle-right on the page; when you hover over it with your mousee, that black title will turn blue to indicate that's a link!)](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/FontOrg-and-FontRenamer/releases). A new page shows up. There you can download **everything** in this repo as (zip) or (tar.gz) archive file by clicking on the links below the **the-whole-shabang** tag.



## What is this?

These tools were posted regularly on alt.bin.fonts by the authors and are very useful tools to organize your TTF/OTF/Type-1 fonts.

FontRenamer does the obvious: renaming the files to a sensible filename (which includes Font Family, etc. as extracted from the font file itseelf),
while FontOrg can organize any set of font files in a directory tree of your choice.

FontOrg was available on http://fontorg.us/ for a while but that website has expired long ago. Its [author's site](http://aljones.us/) is still up, but covers a *quite different subject*: family genealogy. 

AFAICT was FontRenamer never published *officially* outside the NNTP channel, though you may look around the net and may dig up a *still older* copy on some freeware/shareware site(s). Make sure to include the name of the author (Philip M. Engel) in your search or you'll hit several other **unrelated** tools!

These tools are made available here for my personal use and may help others dig up these oldies.

No sourcecode available, alas.

FontOrg v3 still runs fine on Windows 10/64 over here. YMMV.

FontRenamer v2 seems slightly more finicky r4e stability on Windows 10/64, even while it's produced in .NET 2.0, which should still be okay ü§î   Anyway, here again: YMMV.

## Notes

- the Designer and other text files provided with this instance of FontOrg is my (*probably patched*) copy from 2015 AD.
- Older versions are stored in the `backups` directory. Try them and see which works if the latest if giving you trouble.
- At times Al would post updates for the Designer.txt and other text files, which serve as driving databases for FontOrg and can be edited in any decent text eeditor, ee.g. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- Nothing of note has been posted since 2014/2015 (I haven't watched *very* closely üïµÔ∏èüò•); the stuff in this repo came off old drives and I've been looking for this a couple of years ago and today once again: nothing useful or trustworthy pops up on the Net. So here's what I got in cold storage. üòÑ The tools are still relevant with the free fonts out there nowadays that are nice but also quite disorganized - at least to my tastes.
- Enjoy. Please *do* apply patience as the tools are old and may need a bit of assistance to get going on your box. Once they do, they'll be pretty fast as they have not changed but your hardware certainly *will have changed*. üòÜüêé
