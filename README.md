## What is this?

These tools were posted regularly on alt.bin.fonts by the authors and are very useful tools to organize your TTF/OTF/Type-1 fonts.

FontRenamer does the obvious: renaming the files to a sensible filename (which includes Font Family, etc. as extracted from the font file itseelf),
while FontOrg can organize any set of font files in a directory tree of your choice.

FontOrg was available on http://fontorg.us/ for a while but that website has expired long ago. Its [author's site](http://aljones.us/) is still up, but covers a *quite different subject*: family genealogy. 

AFAICT was FontRenamer never published *officially* outside the NNTP channel, though you may look around the net and may dig up a *still older* copy on some freeware/shareware site(s). Make sure to include the name of the author (Philip M. Engel) in your search or you'll hit several other **unrelated** tools!

These tools are made available here for my personal use and may help others dig up these oldies.

No sourcecode available, alas.

FontOrg v3 still runs fine on Windows 10/64 over here. YMMV.

FontRenamer v2 seems slightly more finicky r4e stability on Windows 10/64, even while it's produced in .NET 2.0, which should still be okay ðŸ¤”   Anyway, here again: YMMV.

## Notes

- the Designer and other text files provided with this instance of FontOrg is my (*probably patched*) copy from 2015 AD.
- Older versions are stored in the `backups` directory. Try them and see which works if the latest if giving you trouble.
