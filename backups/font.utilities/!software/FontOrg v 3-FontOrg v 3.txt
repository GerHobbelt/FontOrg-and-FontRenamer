Yes, contrary to my disclaimers I have done an update to FontOrg!  The
changes have all been internal, I'm no longer using the registry to
keep your options, the being stashed in a file in "$APPDATA" 

This is a beta ... it seems as if all my releases are beta releases,
sure would be nice to have a dependable "tester" again rather than
having to dump a program that only *I* have tested out here.

Any comments can be left in the blog at http://fontorg.us (from which
you can also download the new version).
If you use the program, when you find designers or foundries that I'm
missing, please upload a copyof one of their files to me at al <at>
fontorg <dot> us and I'll update the data files and reissue them.
