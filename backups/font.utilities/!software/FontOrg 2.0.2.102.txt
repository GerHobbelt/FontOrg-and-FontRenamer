I've added a "feature" to FontOrg ... rather than moving / copying the
files I've given the option to create shortcuts to them.  FontOrg is
available at http://FontOrg.us/forum
Assuming that you've run FontOrg and distributed your files into the
order that you normally like to see them, you can now (from the tools
-> options menu) select "Create Shortcuts" to sort them differently
without any impact on your original files.
Let's say that you want to see how they'd look if you sorted them by
Panose Family ( Display, Script, Decorative, Pictorial ) then you need
to simply select "Pan Family" from the sort by drop down - and wait ((
sorry, it takes as much time to create the shortcuts as it does to do
the original sort )).
There are several new, and to me interesting, sort options available.
Others can be implemented on request.
