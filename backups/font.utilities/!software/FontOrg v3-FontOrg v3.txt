I'm in the process of preparing a new release of FontOrg (if you're
unfamiliar with it, visit FontOrg.us).
I've added about 100 new Designers and about as many new Foundries.

If you'd like an update, please send me your "_unknown\_unknown"
folder and I'll make sure to get as many of your unknowns identified
as I can.  You can fix my minor abfuscation in my email and use that,
or upload them here to the attenion of AlJones.

If you're using the program and have comments / suggestions, please
feel free to give me any comments you have.  Here, please.
