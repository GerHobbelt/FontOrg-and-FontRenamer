FontOrg v2 BETA is available on my website at www.fontorg.us.  Type 1 and
raster fonts are not currently supported, but I'd like some feedback on how
this method works for you.

I accept no responsibility if you use this on live files and lose
everything (so far, I haven't ... but it is BETA test)

There are several new sort orders and comes as a 
Windows installer package (fontorg202.msi)

PLease give me any feedback you think appropriate, either here or via email
(not to this email addy!)
