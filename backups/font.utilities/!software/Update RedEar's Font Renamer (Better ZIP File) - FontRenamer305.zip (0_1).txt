Sorry. The first version of this message included a zip file that some
decompression programs might not be able to open. This one should be
better.


Existing Users:

This is an update of RedEar's Font Renamer. All users of Font Renamer
should install this update, particularly if you are running an
operating system later then Windows XP.

This update contains the following fixes and enhancements:

- Fixed View File Sample action for users of Windows Vista and later

- Fixed tab stops in Font Name Info text box for users of Windows
Vista and later

- Changed program icon and added extra large (256x256) image for users
of Windows Vista and later

As always, please post suggestions and bug reports to
alt.binaries.fonts.

The latest version of RedEar's Font Renamer can also be found on the
Extra tab at http://abfonts.freehostia.com/.


New Users:

Please read the "Getting Started" sections in the help file before
using the program!

RedEar's Font Renamer is a Windows utility program that consistently
and automatically changes a font's external file name to match the
font's internal  name. Thus, for example, when looking at a renamed
file in Windows Explorer, you will see "Chaparral MM.pfb" rather than
"xtr_____.pfb",  a much more comprehensible name. In other words, you
get a meaningful file name, not a cryptic file name (which in most
cases was created  under the outdated 8.3 file naming conventions).

Because of individual whims or variations in the ways older automated
renamers handle characters that are invalid in a file name, many fonts
in the public domain are circulating with different names. A font
renamer allows you to bring consistency to your font collection and in
the process identify possible duplicates. (Note that there do exist
many font files that have the same internal name but are in fact
different fonts with different glyphs. Often, however, files with the
same internal name are in fact the same font.)

Font Renamer robustly renames all types of font files and related
files. It has extensive options to control the specific internal name
that is used for renaming, to handle invalid characters, and to fine
tune the renaming process. However, the default settings are
recommended for most users.

Font Renamer optionally checks that a font can actually be installed
by your operating system and can flag fonts that cannot.

Font Renamer does not change the contents of font files nor does it
fix bad fonts.

Note that you must have Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 (the necessary
run-time files) installed. See the "Before You Begin" section in the
help file for information on obtaining the Framework if you have not
yet installed it.

If you are running a different operating system, you should look at
FontRename, one of several Java-based utilities by Keith Fenske, also
available on the Extra tab at http://abfonts.freehostia.com/ (as well
as other sites).
