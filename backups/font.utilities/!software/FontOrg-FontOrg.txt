I see that I haven't put up anything about FontOrg recently but wondeer how
many of you might be using my program and would be interested in an update
to the data files?
In other words, is it worth my while to continue to update them or not?
If you're interested FontOrg is available on my website at FontOrg.us along
with RedEars Fontrenamer.
