NOTE#1: This font is licensed as Freeware. Intellectual rights and property remains to the legit owner and author, Gabriele Magurno. If you plan to redistribute this font on magazines, CD-ROMs or websites, you must leave the package intact with the same files you've found on the original, available at my site. You may NOT ask/earn money with this font directly (e.g. by selling it) but you're free to use it for commercial projects (logos, flyers, posters, etc...) A credit or a link back to my site (www.magurno.com) aren't required, but they are always appreciated.

Note#2: This typeface is ideal for logos and general design.
It isn't very suitable to be used with word-processors as it lacks some symbols and letters.

NOTE#3: Thanks to all the people around the world supporting my work! :-)
