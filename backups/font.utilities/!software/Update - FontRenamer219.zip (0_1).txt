Existing Users:

This is the periodic update of Font Renamer. It contains the following
fix and enhancement:

- Corrected path name in message generated if an error occurs at start
of processing subfolders

- Enhanced and corrected error information in ErrorLog.txt

All users are urged to upgrade to this version and to review the
Version History in the help file for a list of all changes. As always,
please post suggestions and bug reports to alt.binaries.fonts.

Thanks to al jones for making the latest version available from his
Web site, http://fontorg.us/.

New Users:

Please read the "Getting Started" sections in the help file before
using the program!

FontRenamer is a utility program that consistently and automatically
changes a font's external file name to match the font's internal name.
Thus, for example, when looking at a renamed file in Windows Explorer,
you will see "Chaparral MM.pfb" rather than "xtr_____.pfb", a much
more comprehensible name. In other words, you get a meaningful file
name, not a cryptic file name (which in most cases was created under
the outdated 8.3 file naming conventions).

Because of individual whims or variations in the ways older automated
renamers handle characters that are invalid in a file name, many fonts
in the public domain are circulating with multiple file names. A font
renamer allows you to bring consistency to your font collection and in
the process identify possible duplicates. (Note that there do exist
many font files that have the same internal name but are in fact
different fonts with different glyphs. Often, however, files with the
same internal name are in fact the same font.)

FontRenamer robustly renames all types of font files and related
files. It has extensive options to control the specific internal name
that is used for renaming, to handle invalid characters, and to fine
tune the renaming process. The default settings will be suitable for
most users, although Windows 98 and Windows ME users may choose to use
the ANSI rather than the Unicode compatibility option.

Font Renamer optionally checks that a font can actually be installed
by your operating system and can flag fonts that cannot.

Font Renamer does not change the contents of font files nor does it
fix bad fonts.

Note that you must have Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 (the necessary
run-time files) installed. (See the "Before You Begin" section in the
help file for information on obtaining the Framework if you have not
yet installed it.)
