Existing users:

This is an early release of Font Renamer version 3.0.1 to fix the
problem in version 3.0.0 that main menu items for showing hidden and
system folders and files do not in fact work. Thanks to Max (aka ND)
for the original bug report.

All users of earlier versions are urged to upgrade to this version and
to review the Version History in the help file for a list of all
changes. As always, please post suggestions and bug reports to
alt.binaries.fonts.


New Users:

Please read the "Getting Started" sections in the help file before
using the program!

Font Renamer is a utility program that consistently and automatically
changes a font's external file name to match the font's internal name.
Thus, for example, when looking at a renamed file in Windows Explorer,
you will see "Chaparral MM.pfb" rather than "xtr_____.pfb", a much
more comprehensible name. In other words, you get a meaningful file
name, not a cryptic file name (which in most cases was created under
the outdated 8.3 file naming conventions).

Because of individual whims or variations in the ways older automated
renamers handle characters that are invalid in a file name, many fonts
in the public domain are circulating with different names. A font
renamer allows you to bring consistency to your font collection and in
the process identify possible duplicates. (Note that there do exist
many font files that have the same internal name but are in fact
different fonts with different glyphs. Often, however, files with the
same internal name are in fact the same font.)

Font Renamer robustly renames all types of font files and related
files. It has extensive options to control the specific internal name
that is used for renaming, to handle invalid characters, and to fine
tune the renaming process. The default settings are recommended for
most users.

Font Renamer optionally checks that a font can actually be installed
by your operating system and can flag fonts that cannot.

Font Renamer does not change the contents of font files nor does it
fix bad fonts.

Note that you must have Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 (the necessary
run-time files) installed. (See the "Before You Begin" section in the
help file for information on obtaining the Framework if you have not
yet installed it.)
