BookOrg and FontOrg

BookOrg is available on the FontOrg website - http://fontorg.us. There
is a blog there - which is where the files are located.

FontOrg friends - I've brought the FontOrg website back up so I you
want to get a copy, it's there as well as RedEars last version of
FontRenamer (v2.04)

Any comments, suggestions and of course assistance is appreciated.

I'm aware that adbloockplus (and other add blockers?) has a problem
with the blog.  If you see a note that you're seeing "this" rather
than the blog, you'll have to disable your addblocker for a while.
(found out the hard way ... couldn't see the blogs while I was working
on the web site - damn near drove me bonkers!)
