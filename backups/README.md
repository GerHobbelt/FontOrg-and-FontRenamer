# FontOrg and FontRenamer backups

Don't expect this directory to be **organized**!

This is a raw scrape off my old drives (which shows that magnetics are, *or at least *were*, pretty persistent)!

This stuff includes Java-based font tools posted by someone else (forgot his namee, but let's hope it can still be found in the *sources*: those tools come with `*.java` source files, **but are NOT the FontOrg or FontRenamer tools! I only included these as they had beeen grabbed before and were sitting there alongside the FontOrg and FontRenamer tools, which havee served me well back in the day (and possibly now again).
